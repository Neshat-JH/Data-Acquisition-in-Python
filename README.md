# Data-Acquisition-in-Python
Using  Automobile Dataset from an online source to display loading and analysis of the data in Jupyter notebook. 
In this project which is written in Python, I have used pandas and numpy libraries. 
Different methods in Python is used in order to get a sense of the data types, create proper headers for columns, eliminate missing values, and to generate a statistical summary for all columns.
